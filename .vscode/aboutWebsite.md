Summary
-------
Evallo is a lead engagement, qualification, automation and intelligence platform that turns static forms and surveys into chat-like, conversational experiences. The site headline: "Understand Your Buyers. Speak Their Language. 100x Your Conversions." The product focuses on improving form completion, identifying high-intent leads in real time, and surfacing buyer motivations using AI-driven flows and analysis.

- Real-time lead qualification and scoring based on business rules (budget, urgency, deal size) with routing to SDRs.
- AI-assisted flow builder: tell Evallo what you want and it generates the conversational flow.
- Deep lead insights and analysis to personalize marketing and tailor sales outreach.
- Designed for sales, marketing, and revenue ops across industries (SaaS, agencies, real estate, e-commerce, freelancers, manufacturing).
